This MERN application consists of a frontend built with React and a backend built with Node.js using Express as the web framework. The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data stored in a MongoDB database.

Backend (Node.js with Express and MongoDB):

The backend code is responsible for handling API requests and interacting with the MongoDB database to perform CRUD operations on student data.\n
The backend code is organized into separate files, such as index.js, models/adminList.js, and models/studentList.js.\n
index.js serves as the entry point for the backend code. It sets up the Express server, establishes a connection with the MongoDB database, and defines API routes for login, creating students, updating students, deleting students, and searching students.\n
The adminList and studentList models define the schemas and models for the admin and student data stored in the MongoDB database.\n
The backend code also includes authentication logic using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It verifies the token sent in the request header for protected routes.\n
The backend code uses various dependencies, such as express, cors, body-parser, mongoose, jsonwebtoken, and fs.\n
The entire project works on HTTP(S) protected http, for which letsencrypt and acme was used.\n
\n
Frontend (React):\n
\n
The frontend code is responsible for displaying the user interface and handling user interactions.\n
The frontend code is organized into separate files, such as index.js, Login.js, 404.js, and Dashboard.js.\n
index.js serves as the entry point for the frontend code. It sets up the React application and renders the root component wrapped in a BrowserRouter for client-side routing.\n
The Login.js component represents the login page. It handles user authentication by sending a POST request to the backend API with the username and password. It also displays toast notifications using react-toastify.\n
The Dashboard.js component represents the dashboard page. It displays a table of student data fetched from the backend API and allows users to add, update, and delete student records. It uses react-toastify for displaying toast notifications and react-router-dom for client-side routing.\n

Additional Concepts and Tools:\n
\n
React Hooks: The code uses React hooks, such as useState and useEffect, to manage state and perform side effects in functional components.\n
React Router: The react-router-dom library is used for client-side routing, allowing navigation between different pages of the application without full page reloads.\n
MongoDB: The code interacts with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve student data. It uses the mongoose library as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for MongoDB.\n
HTTP Requests: The frontend code makes HTTP requests to the backend API using the fetch API or axios library to perform CRUD operations on student data.\n
Toast Notifications: The react-toastify library is used to display toast notifications for success, error, or informational messages to the user.\n
CSS Styling: The code includes CSS files (Login.css and Dashboard.css) to style the login and dashboard pages of the application.\n
